# NLP2SQL: Chat with Your SQL Database üîç

Welcome to **NLP2SQL**, a Streamlit-based application that allows users to interact with a SQL database using natural language. Powered by Azure OpenAI, LangChain, and Vector Search, this tool simplifies database exploration with an intuitive chat interface.

## Features

- **Natural Language to SQL**: Convert plain language queries into SQL commands.
- **Embedded Knowledge Base**: Retrieve proper nouns like artist names or album titles using FAISS for more precise filtering.
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Engage with the database through a user-friendly Streamlit chat interface.

## Files in the Repository

- **`.env`**: Contains environment variables for the Azure OpenAI configuration.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists required Python libraries.
- **`Chinook.db`**: A sample SQLite database.
- **`app.py`**: The main application file that connects LangChain, Azure OpenAI, and the Chinook database.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sifinell/NLP2SQL.git
    cd NLP2SQL
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up the environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:

    ```plaintext
    AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="your-azure-openai-endpoint"
    AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="your-azure-openai-api-key"
    AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="gpt-4o"
    AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION="2024-05-01-preview"
    ```

   - Replace `your-azure-openai-endpoint` and `your-azure-openai-api-key` with your Azure OpenAI deployment details.

4. **Run the application**:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
